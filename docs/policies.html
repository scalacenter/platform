<p>The Platform process establishes some policies to deal with the governance and
organization of the modules.</p>
<p>These policies have a major goal: they enable companies and industrial
users to contribute back to the modules, and help into its maintenance.
In exchange, the Platform provides serious stability guarantees to users and
basic building blocks to evolve friendly communities in the Scala ecosystem.</p>
<p>These building blocks are two: a predictable development workflow and a
clear contract to maintain and contribute to the modules. Altogether, they
help maintainers and contributors, and encourage users to depend on the Platform
in production systems.</p>

<p>A release train model consists in a regular pre-planned schedule of software

</li>
<li>
<p>Public methods marked experimental belong to the Experimental API.
They do not ensure backwards compatibility and may be removed

<p>The Platform process uses a modified version of C4, a contract designed for
open-source projects and communities by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Hintjens">Pieter Hintjens</a>.
The modifications affect licensing and adds specific Scala Platform requirements.</p>
<p>Being used at successful communities like ZeroMQ, C4 has proven its value
when building thriving open-source communities capable of producing high-quality
software. In the best spirit of the Scala Platform process, the following contract
hopes to reproduce their success in the Scala community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Collective Code Construction Contract (C4) is an evolution of the github.com <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Fork + Pull Model</a>, aimed at providing an optimal collaboration model for open-source software projects. This is revision 3 of the C4 specification, tailored specifically for the Scala Platform process.</p>

<p>C4 provides a standard process for contributing, evaluating and discussing improvements on software projects. It defines specific technical requirements for projects like a style guide, unit tests, <code class="hljs">git</code> and similar platforms. It also establishes different personas for projects, with clear and distinct duties. C4 specifies a process for documenting and discussing issues including seeking consensus and clear descriptions, use of &quot;pull requests&quot; and systematic reviews.</p>
<h3 id="language" class="a_section" data-magellan-target="language">Language<a class="a_hlink" href="#language"></a></h3>
<p>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<h3 id="goals" class="a_section" data-magellan-target="goals">1. Goals<a class="a_hlink" href="#goals"></a></h3>
<p>C4 is meant to provide a reusable optimal collaboration model for open source software projects. It has these specific goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>To maximize the scale and diversity of the community around a project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks;</li>
<li>To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any required domain;</li>
<li>To allow the project to develop faster and more accurately, by increasing the diversity of the decision making process;</li>
<li>To support the natural life cycle of project versions from experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation, rapid failure, and isolation of stable code;</li>
<li>To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the scope for error;</li>
<li>To enforce collective ownership of the project, which increases economic incentive to Contributors and reduces the risk of hijack by hostile entities.</li>
</ol>

<li>The project SHALL use the Platform Host issue tracker.</li>
<li>The project SHOULD have clearly documented guidelines for code style.</li>
<li>A &quot;Contributor&quot; is a person who wishes to provide a patch, being a set of commits that solve some clearly identified problem.</li>

<li>Change on the project SHALL be governed by the pattern of accurately identifying problems and applying minimal, accurate solutions to these problems.</li>
<li>To request changes, a user SHOULD log an issue on the project Platform Host issue tracker.</li>
<li>The user or Contributor SHOULD write the issue by describing the problem they face or observe.</li>
<li>The user or Contributor SHOULD seek consensus on the accuracy of their observation, and the value of solving the problem.</li>

<li>Thus, the release history of the project SHALL be a list of meaningful issues logged and solved.</li>
<li>To work on an issue, a Contributor SHALL fork the project repository and then work on their forked repository.</li>
<li>To submit a patch, a Contributor SHALL create a Platform Host pull request back to the project.</li>
<li>A Contributor SHALL NOT commit changes directly to the project.</li>
<li>If the Platform Host implements pull requests as issues, a Contributor MAY directly send a pull request without logging a separate issue.</li>
<li>To discuss a patch, people MAY comment on the Platform Host pull request, on the commit, or elsewhere.</li>
<li>To accept or reject a patch, a Maintainer SHALL use the Platform Host interface.</li>
<li>Maintainers SHOULD NOT merge their own patches except in exceptional cases, such as non-responsiveness from other Maintainers for an extended period (more than 1-2 days).</li>
<li>Maintainers SHALL NOT make value judgments on correct patches.</li>
<li>Maintainers SHALL merge correct patches from other Contributors rapidly.</li>
<li>Maintainers MAY merge incorrect patches from other Contributors with the goals of (a) ending fruitless discussions, (b) capturing toxic patches in the historical record, (c) engaging with the Contributor on improving their patch quality.</li>
<li>The user who created an issue SHOULD close the issue after checking the patch is successful.</li>
<li>Any Contributor who has value judgments on a patch SHOULD express these via their own patches.</li>
<li>Maintainers SHOULD close user issues that are left open without action for an uncomfortable period of time.</li>
<li>Any official release of the project must abide by the <a href="policies.html#release">Scala Platform release process</a>.</li>

<li>All Public Contracts (APIs or protocols) SHALL be documented.</li>
<li>All Public Contracts SHOULD have space for extensibility and experimentation.</li>
<li>A patch that modifies a stable Public Contract SHOULD not break existing applications unless there is overriding consensus on the value of doing this.</li>
<li>A patch that introduces new features SHOULD do so using new names (a new contract).</li>
<li>New contracts SHOULD be marked as &quot;draft&quot; until they are stable and used by real users.</li>
<li>Old contracts SHOULD be deprecated in a systematic fashion by marking them as &quot;deprecated&quot; and replacing them with new contracts as needed.</li>

<li>The Administrators SHALL ensure their own succession over time by promoting the most effective Maintainers.</li>
<li>A new Contributor who makes correct patches, who clearly understands the project goals, and the process SHOULD be invited to become a Maintainer.</li>
<li>Administrators SHOULD remove Maintainers who are inactive for an extended period of time, or who repeatedly fail to apply this process accurately.</li>
<li>Administrators SHOULD block or ban &quot;bad actors&quot; who cause stress and pain to others in the project. This should be done after public discussion, with a chance for all parties to speak. A bad actor is someone who repeatedly ignores the rules and culture of the project, who is needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who is offensive, and who is unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others.</li>
