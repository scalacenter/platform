# Why become a module?

The focus of the Scala Platform process is on *growing communities
around the Platform modules*. For that, it enforces commonly-approved
open-source rules that optimize the experience of contributors and
maintainers, and provides infrastructure that makes easier developers'
life.

1.  High-quality build machines that ensure a fast and responsive development cycle.
    
2.  Organizational help.

    *  [Scala Center Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B57XIj2zIh7xx1syKvS3qfC4L8usd0pI0yTSrJMfuew/edit#);
    *  Process to elect maintainers, committers and evolve the modules;
    *  Policies on ticket management, PR & core reviews policies;
    
> {.note}
> In the future, when the Scala Platform consists of an initial set of libraries
> and maintainers, this set may be extended to:
>   *  Scala documentation website (public scaladoc);
>   *  Good-looking website under an official Scala namespace;
>   *  Template and infrastructure to write and update the docs; and
>   *  Integration with online Scala REPL-like tools to provide reproducible code snippets.
    
3.  Release of modules.

    *  Maintainers of module have access to servers and CI.
    *  Automation for nightly builds, milestones, release candidates and stable releases.
    *  Modules maintainers that want to release changes on every merge are
       encouraged to do so, and our infrastructure accommodates this use case.
    *  The automatic release process checks compatibility of releases according
       to our [stability guarantees](policies.md#release).

The above services focus on improving the development experience,
removing the overhead of getting the contribution rules and the infrastructure
right.
